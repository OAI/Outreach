# OpenAPI Initiative Newsletter – December 2025

Welcome to the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) December 2025 newsletter! This is our
last newsletter of 2025, and we'll be reflecting on what the community has
accomplished this year as well as looking forward to 2026!

### Events News

In a change from routine, in this edition of the newsletter we are starting with
Events news as our OpenAPI Conference at FOST, the conference formerly known as
Apidays, starts December 9! This year the OAI Track has been promoted to a full
subconference, with a full agenda on December 11.

Highlights of the full program at FOST include:

- [Erik Wilde]() and [Frank Kilcommins]() wil be running a workshop "API
  Management for the AI Era: Leveraging OpenAPI Standards" (registration
  required) which gets to the heart of how you can leverage OAI specifications
  for AI.

- We are hosting an Executive Breakfast where you can learn more about what it
  means to be an OAI member and meet members of the community. This is an
  invite-only event, so watch your inbox!

- Our subconference starts at 0915 on the Wednesday, and highlights include
  What's New in OpenAPI 3.2 ([Lorna Mitchell]()), API Workflow Testing and
  Mocking with a Single Arazzo Spec ([Naresh Jain]()), and Is OpenAPI still
  relevant in the age of AI? ([Emmanuel Paraskakis]()).

2026 promises to be an exciting year and in bringing 2025 to close our OAI
Ambassador and custodian of the OAI Track Erik Wilde puts the outlook for future
events like this: "_For the past two years, OAI has actively fostered the
OpenAPI community with organizing events at various events, most recently with
our first OpenAPI Conference at API Days Paris. We plan on continuing these
efforts in 2026, tentatively planning events in San Jose, Singapore, New York,
London, Santa Clara, and Paris. If you're interested in APIs and OpenAPI, join
us at one of these events in 2026! We also just launched our very own
[conference site](https://conference.openapis.org/) so that going forward, you
can find up-to-date information about all of our events in one place._"

Our new conference and events website has been created to help highlight the
work that OAI is doing bringing in-person events to the community, and will
provide a complete picture of the agendas, talk and workshop abstracts, and
speaker profiles in one place. Massive thanks here to
[Pavel Kornev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelkornev/), from OAI member SAP,
who led the project with a clear vision for a cleaner, more modern experience,
with [Juri Jatschmenow's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jurijat/) outstanding
development work bringing that vision to life. On his teams contributions, Pavel
says: "_Designing the new OpenAPI Conference Paris 2025 landing page has been an
exciting journey for our team. We’re both proud to contribute to the OpenAPI
Initiative and thrilled to support an event that brings the community together.
This is just the beginning — we’re looking forward to enhancing even more
landing pages across the Initiative._"

### Initiative News

There’s been a great reception to our OpenAPI Specification v3.2 release, with a
great deal of coverage and interest from the community in the new features and
capabilities. As a reminder, v3.2 provides a host of changes such as the
refactored and improved [Tag Object](), support for the `QUERY` HTTP Method,
support for sequential and streaming data protocols, and additional Security
Scheme features like OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow. You can find out more
in our
[blog post](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2025/09/23/announcing-openapi-v3-2)),
which includes links to key resource to help with upgrading to v3.2. Our
[Ecosystem Spotlight](#ecosystem-spotlight) also provides resources from the
community on what the v3.2 upgrade means.

Completing v3.2 means we are now looking at what could appear in our next
version and beyond, and the team is ramping up for further releases in 2026,
with an expected v3.3, covering improvements to Security Schemes and greater
integration with MCP and AI protocols more generally.

[Henry Andrews](https://github.com/handrews) has already pulled together a
comprehensive plan of what could be in the next version. If you want to look at
what's in the frame, contribute ideas, or just keep in touch head over to the
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/handrews) on the topic.

> Placeholder for Arazzo updates.

Overlay is also gearing up for a v1.1.0 release, with several features in the
frame such as clarifications to format interoperability and a new Parameter
Object in the frame. If you want to contribute or simply find out more about
what's going on, head over to the
[Overlay Specification repository](https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification).

### Ecosystem Spotlight

We've already mentioned the release of v3.2 and we've had a great feedback from
the community. Here's a few samples of what folks are saying.

- [Dave Shanley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveshanley/) brought together a
  really comprehensive [overview](https://quobix.com/articles/openapi-3.2/) of
  all the new features of v3.2 ("_I love that new feature smell _") with plenty
  of snippets showing exactly how to implement them.

- [Anton Okolelov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-okolelov/) also
  [dug deep](https://medium.com/@okoanton/openapi-3-2-0-evolving-with-modern-api-patterns-9977972e9381)
  in his overview, describing streaming support as "_a long overdue addition_".
  He summarizes the value of v3.2 in this way: "_While no specification can
  anticipate every future pattern, OpenAPI 3.2.0 demonstrates a willingness to
  adapt to observed practices rather than dictating them. That’s a healthy
  approach for any evolving standard._"

- [Zaid Daba'een](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaiddabaeen/) describes the update
  as focusing "_...on the real pain points that show up when you scale: messy
  docs, patchy auth support, and unclear streaming behavior._"

For the contributors involved in the creation of v3.2, this level of validation
is vital for the ongoing development of the OpenAPI Initiative Specifications.
Getting great feedback - good and bad - which puts the new features in context
are critical to address new features in future versions in earnest, and
delivering what the OpenAPI, Arazzo, and Overlay communities really need.

### Membership

The work on the Conference website shows the power of the our community, in that
a member organization helped bring an exciting new resource to life. We worked
hard on revamping our member proposition this year, and next year we are hoping
to bring exciting new features to life. If you are interest in becoming a
member, head over to the membership page on our website to find out more.

### Finally

Thank you for reading our newsletter. As always, we welcome suggestions on how
we can improve it or bring you information that can help make the most of how
you use specifications published by the OpenAPI Initiative.

Please get in touch on the Outreach channel on Slack if you would like to work
with us to tell your story, to feature in the Ecosystem Spotlight section, or
get involved with any of the initiatives described above. We’d also like from
organizations, tooling makers, or community members on their reaction to our
v3.2 release, and to share any stories in their adoption journey.

Until next time!
