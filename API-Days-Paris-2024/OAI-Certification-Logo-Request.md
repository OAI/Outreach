# Design for OAI Certification Digital Badge

We are looking to get a design for "digital badges" that OAI can issue for trainings and courses. One of the important aspects is to turn these badges into something that learners can easily share online (for example on their social feeds) so that they also act as some marketing for OAI.

The starting point has the right ideas in there but has problems with colors, readability, and alignment. We would like to get a "digital badge" that satisfies the following criteria:

- Clearly showing that this certificate has been issued by the OpenAPI Initiative.

- Visually simple so that it can be easily scaled and shared in a variety of ways.

- Using the OAI color scheme. Ability to have alternate versions for dark and light backgrounds and possibly even greyscale versions.

- Incorporating the "issuer" ("apiMasters" in the example) but in a way that allows to also represent other issuers.

- Incorporating the certificate's "Short Name" ("Advanced OpenAPI" in the example)

- Ability to represent various "levels" (one to three stars with the example shown two stars).
