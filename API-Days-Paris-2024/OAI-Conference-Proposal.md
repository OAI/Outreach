# OAI Conference at API Days Paris

We have received an offer from the organizers of API Days Paris to organize a full-day dedicated "OpenAPI Conference" that will be part of API Days Paris (December 3-5, 2024, https://www.apidays.global/paris/).


## Goals of OAI

OAI wants to increase visibility and attract new members. OAI also wants to start offering more education and training that helps practitioners to use OpenAPI and other specification correctly and effectively.

To this end, here are the goals OAI hopes to achieve with the Paris event:

- Increase visibility in the community and engage with the community for better feedback and input for future work.

- Establish training and education to help practitioners work with the specification, learn about practices and patterns, and learn about tooling.

- Rework the membership value proposition and use the event to start a new member push. While the membership value proposition is work in progress, it's likely to have a focus that switches from mainly attracting members that create OpenAPI tooling to members who use OpenAPI strategically as part of their developer and API platforms.


## Proposal by API Days

Here are the details of the proposal:

- OAI pays a flat fee of $20k.

- OAI and API Days agree to engage in marketing the event to the best of their abilities on their respective channels. It is not clear yet who will be in charge of creating and maintaining the conference's Web presence.

- OAI agrees to cover travel and accommodation for at least two representatives of OAI.

- The OpenAPI Conference will issue dedicated tickets at a price of $299. OAI can issue an unlimited number of free tickets. There will be space for at least 300 participants. OAI will get a Gold-level sponsor booth at the expo.

- API days organizes up to four full-day workshops. These will be taught by recognized experts, will have a price between $500 to $1000 per participant, with OAI members getting a significant reduction. There will be a revenue share between instructors and API days. Official OAI certificates and badges will be issued, and OAI will actively help marketing the workshops. Workshop participants get a free ticket for the conference.

- The current timing looks like the workshops will be on day 1 (December 3) and the OpenAPI Conference will be on day 3 (December 5), but this schedule may still change.
