## 💡 About the OpenAPI Initiative

The [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)](https://openapis.org) was created by a consortium
of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of
standardizing on how APIs are described. As an open governance structure under
the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a
vendor neutral description format. The OpenAPI Specification was originally
based on the Swagger Specification, donated by SmartBear Software.
